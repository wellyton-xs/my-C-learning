# My learning of C

This repository has the code that I
generated in my C learning.

When I start my apprenticeship, I
realized I should make my work more
easier, because I didn't want to use 
the IDE that the study article recommended

I want do all the examples and exercises
in the command line, that makes all more
simple.

first create a C file, make code and execute
gcc! is that wonderful!

but compile all of the examples are very tiring.
but has no problem, I create a script to do that.
I know, must be a better and existant way to do 
this, but really like working on my own solutions.

to use the comp, the script that I created, use:

obs: create a src and target folder and move all
of your source code to src.

	./comp

this will compile all of your C files and throw it 
on target folder!
